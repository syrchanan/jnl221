For contrast, give it a background color of white. The widest
it can be is 930 pixels. Add some padding on the left and right, then

Use margins to have it right justified, and set the font to Tahoma.*/

default margin on the bottom (try something like 15 pixels).*/

text be gray (#767676) instead of black.*/

14 pixels, make it bold and give it a color of #5076b8*/

/*---------LEAD IMAGE-----------*/

/*We want this div holding our photo and caption to have the same max
width, margins and alignment as the story top above. This should 
be a copy/paste job for style properties.*/

/*If we don't set our image's width to 100%, it'll overrun the div and
look massive.*/

/*Caption should be the same color and size as the timestamp above.
Instead of Tahoma as the font, use Arial. Also: give it a small
margin at the top, or else it will be way below the image.
Caption will be even narrower: 700 pixels max. Finally: adjust the
"line-height" to 20 pixels, which will add some space between the
lines of text.*/

/*We're going to use a nice serif Georgia font here that's 18 pixels.
Again, we're going to use the same max width, as the divs above.
Adjust the line height here so that the story copy doesn't seem too
crowded together.*/

/*Like our caption, the paragraphs within the story text div are going to
have a max width of 700 pixels. (How can you select only paragraph elements
within this div?)*/

font as the story top and 22 pixels in size. They should also have
the same max width as the story paragraphs*/
