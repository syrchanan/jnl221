			<p>
				NFL officials have fined the Green Bay Packers, quarterback Aaron Rodgers and wide receiver Allen Lazard
				for violating the league's COVID-19 safety protocols.
			</p>

			<p>
				League officials had launched an investigation into the Packers' adherence to safety protocols after
				Rodgers, the league's reigning MVP, <a

					target="_blank">tested positive for the coronavirus last week</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				According to the NFL, Rodgers and Lazard's fines are a result of attending a Halloween party. With both
				players not vaccinated, they are prohibited from attending gatherings outside team facilities. The
				infraction resulted in a $14,650 fine for each player.
			</p>

			<p>
				The NFL handed the Packers organization a $300,000 fine for its part in not properly enforcing safety
				protocols, including allowing Rodgers to not wear a mask at press conferences and not disciplining the
				players despite knowing about the Halloween party after it happened.
			</p>

			<p>
				"We respect the League's findings and we recognize the importance of adherence to the COVID protocols to
				keep our team and organization safe and healthy," Packers president Mark Murphy said in a statement. "We
				will continue to educate the team regarding the importance of the protocols and remain committed to
				operating within the protocols."
			</p>

			<p>
				ESPN first reported the fines.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Packers were also notified that future violations could result in more severe discipline, including
				lowered or lost draft picks. Last season, the New Orleans Saints had a sixth-round pick in the 2022
				draft taken away after repeated violations of the NFL's COVID-19 protocols.
			</p>

			<p>
				With Rodgers sidelined by the diagnosis and league protocols on Sunday, the Packers lost 13-7 to the
				Kansas City Chiefs. He remains at home as part of a league-imposed 10-day quarantine.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The quarterback's comments on his vaccination status cause a stir
			</h2>

			<p>
				In August, Rodgers told reporters that he had been "immunized" when asked whether he'd been vaccinated.
				He sought an exemption from protocols based on his antibody levels before the season, but the exemption
				was denied.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQ2fcaf70w" target="_blank">Speaking Tuesday on YouTube and SiriusXM's The Pat McAfee Show</a>, Rodgers discussed his decision to not be
				vaccinated and earlier comments he has made on the subject.
			</p>

			<p>
				"I shared an opinion that's polarizing," Rodgers told McAfee, a former NFL punter and kicker who has
				garnered a wide audience commentating on sports. "I get it. And I misled some people about my status,
				which I take full responsibility of, those comments. But in the end, I have to stay true to who I am and
				what I'm about. I stand behind the things that I said."
			</p>

			<p>
				Discussing vaccines four days before on the same outlet, Rodgers explained his reasons for avoiding a
				shot.
			</p>

			<p>
				The star quarterback said he sought alternative treatments rather than the NFL-endorsed vaccinations
				because he is allergic to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. He did not specify which
				ingredient.
